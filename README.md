### TD:LR

This is the repository for a short screenplay with the working title “2%”. 

### Tagline

The short film is about an eritrean woman that is haunted by difficult memories from her past, and that complicates her relationship with her teenage daughter. Synopsis can be read (here).

### PDF

Latest build of the script is regularly uploaded [here].  

### Contribute

The screenplay was initiated, and this repository is maintained by Ruben Sznajderman. Anybody is welcome to clone the code for the purpose of tinkering, edit, correct, comment, improve and push the script back to the head developer – just like with open source software. The license and legal disclaimer can be read [here].

If don’t know anything about git, repositories or the fountain syntax, and wondering what a the heck a screenplay is doing on platform for programmers for code, read [this]

### Prerequisites

To contribute to the script, one must only have git installed, and a editor that can handle plain text – although software dedicated to Fountain syntax (or one with the right plugins), may give a superior experience. To see some options, see this [link].

Follow [these instructions] on how to install Git on OS X, Windows and Linux
