# 2 Procent [SCREENPLAY]

## About
This is the repository for the open source screenplay of a short film with the working title *2% procent*.

### Tagline

A short film about an eritrean migrant that is living in Sweden with her teenage daughter and how their relationship is influenced by the mothers difficult past. Synopsis can be read [here].

### Read the script

The latest version of the script can be downloaded as an PDF from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/68zze6i9t9zne5z/AACOvYiNDeTl01ULEmjbZaD3a?dl=0)

### Project status
Update: 2019-02-05 - The screenplay is in development and the latest build is being shared with indie film producers for feedback.

### Noobs

If you come from filmmaking and  don’t know anything about git, repositories, fountain syntax, and wondering what a the heck a screenplay is doing on platform for programmers for code, feel free to read [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-git-and-how-to-use-it-c341b049ae61)


### Contribute

The story and first draft was written by [rubensz](https://github.com/rubensz), who also is maintaining this repository during development. Anybody is welcome to clone the script for the purpose of tinkering, edit, correct, comment, improve and push the “code” back to the head developer – just like with open source software.

I will share more on my thoughts on authorship rights and what I hope to be the future of copyright.

### Prerequisites

To contribute to the script, one must only have git installed, and a editor that can handle plain text – although software dedicated to Fountain syntax (or one with Fountain plugins), gives a superior writing experience. To see some options, see this [link](https://fountain.io/apps).

Follow [these instructions](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03) on how to install Git on OS X, Windows and Linux

### Cloning

After you have installed git, open a terminal shell, navigate to the folder you want to download the screenplay in to, paste this command and press enter.

```
git clone  https://github.com/rubensz/2procent.git
```

### Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426) for details on submitting pull requests to the head writer.

### Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning as a source of inspiration and best practice. I hope create a versioning scheme for screenplays in the future.
