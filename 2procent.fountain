INT. SUBURBAN APARTMENT -TEENAGE BEDROOM- NIGHT

JESSICA (13) sits on the floor while REBECCA (14), braiding Jessica�s hair, sits on the bed.
WENDY (14) is on her phone.

REBECCA
I don�t think he�s cute at all.

WENDY
He is! He got those bumps in his cheeks when he smiles, you know.

JESSICA
Aoh!

REBECCA
Sorri!!

WENDY
I�m so full look at my stomach, I�m preggo.

JESSICA
We need to get you a day after pill.

HALLWAY

HELEN (45) enters with Lidl-bags in her hands and a cellphone between her shoulder and ear.

HELEN
(into the phone)
Yes, sir
(Pause)
No, I understand

She kicks off her shoes and marches on.

KITCHEN
HELEN enters still on the phone.

HELEN
(into the phone)
No, sir. It won�t happen again.

She places her groceries in the fridge.

HELEN
(into the phone)
Yes, tired to tell them but they wouldn�t listen.
(Pause)
It won�t happen again.
(Pause)
Is there any way I could�
(Pause)
Ok,, I see, sir.
(Pause)
But maybe I could�
(Pause)
Hello? Hello?

She looks at her phone, makes a face, draws a sight and drops her head.
She bangs her fist on the kitchen sink.

HELEN
(to self)
Damnit.

She looks up and notices that the kitchen is in disarray

TEENAGE BEDROOM

REBECCA
Yeah, right! As if you would�

Knock on the door.

Rebecca gets up to the check the door.

HELEN (O.S)
(to Rebecca)
Can I talk to you for a min?

WENDY and JESSICA look at each other.

KITCHEN

CRASH!!!
Dirty plates, utensils and other kitchenware tumbles after being thrown in the sink.

HELEN
What have  I told you about leaving the kitchen like this?!

REBECCA
Relax we where going�

HELEN
Do you think it�s nice to work a twelve hour shit and come home to this?

Doorbell rings.

REBECCA
We had just eaten, I was going�

HELEN
Stop. Don�t. I don�t want to hear your excuses, young lady.


Helen drops the rest of the disher into the sink.

REBECCA
Why you gotta be so angry we were gonna do it.

HELEN
WHY? I got enough pressure-

TEENAGE BEDROOM
WENDY and JESSICA stare with empty eyes to the shouting from the kitchen.

HELEN (O.S)
(Muffled, from kitchen)
-on me to take care of this household! You know this!

KITCHEN

HELEN
Who pays for the food?! Who has to make sure we make rent?! Who pays for your phone?! Is it to much to ask that you and your friends clean up after yourselves?

Doorbell rings

REBECCA
We were gonna do it! OK!!!

Rebecca grabs some dirty dishes and throws them into the sink.

CRASH!

Helen is stunned.

REBECCA
Why you gotta be such a nutbag. Why can�t be more like other moms?

Rebecca leaves Helen at the sink.

HELEN
Let your friend in before that bell gives me a migraine.

REBECCA
I�m not expecting anyone.

Rebecca slams the door after helerself.
Helen draws a sigh.

Doorbell rings

FRONT DOOR
HELEN opens and is met with the friendly face of a dark, scrawny MAN (59)

MAN
Helen.

HELEN
Yes?

MAN
O�Hello. Hope I�m not disturbing, miss.

HELEN
Well, it depends.

MAN
My name is Isaak Berhane. I�m with the E.F.R.N.P

HELEN
The resistance?

He gives her a timid smile.

HELEN
I have nothing to do with that, I don�t understand politics.

She reaches for the door knob.

ISAAK
I have a message from Erritrea.

Helen freezes

HELEN
A message?

ISAAK
From your sister.

Helen thinks.

KITCHEN

HELEN slides a hot cup over the tables and takes a seat.

ISAAK
Thank you so much.

HELEN
Careful

ISAAC
Nice and hot, just like how I like it.

He takes a sip.

ISAAK
Aaah. Just like back home. Never gotten used to cold and how they make the coffee there.

Helen stares at him, anticipating.

ISAAK
So, I work as an interpreter for the immigration services.

HELEN
You must be busy.

ISAAK
Yes, many young people are fleeing� many.
As an agent for FDJR I�m also collecting intelligence about the conditions in the army, in the country.

HELEN
Authorities here know you�re doing this?

ISAAK
The Authorities here?

He chuckles.

ISAAK
So there was this young girl that had come here with heer brother and his friend.
They were quite shaken by the journey but in good health. Said she was a friend of your sister and promised to bring you this.

He pushes the coffee cup aside and puts his briefcase on the table. He takes out a folder, puts the briefcase aside and scrolls throught the folder.

ISAAK
(to self)
Let�s see, Let�s see. Where did I put it, where did I put it?

Helen is trembling

ISAAK
Ah! Here it is!.

He pulls out a zip bag and puts it before Helen.

She stares at the small bag.

ISAAK
Well, what are you waiting for? Open it.

Helen opens the zip bag, reaches in with fingers and pulls out a photograph.

Her tense face is overcome with a jolt of joy.

HELEN
Oh my god.

ISAAK
Nice, ey

She palms her mouth, trying to hold back the tears.

Isaak puts on his reading glasses and leans over the table.

ISAAK
If I correctly that is your sister - that I�m sure you recognize- but this fellow you might not now- that is her husband Abraham, that is their son David, that is their oldest son Senay and that little girl is their youngest. I think she said her names was� her names was� Selam!
Isaak sits back, amused.

HELEN
(Crying joyfully)
I can�t believe this!
Wow!

They both laugh.

ISAAK
Amazing, right!

HELEN
Yes!

The laughter settles, she looks closer at the picture.

Her smile turns to a frown. HE notices that something is wrong.
She places the photo on her table and looks at him dead serious.

HELEN
You�re not with the EJPN, Where did you get that photo?

He looks at her confused.

ISAAK
What do you mean? I told you just now that I got it-

HELEN
No family or young girl in Massaa could afford a photo like this.

Beat

ISAAK
MIss, you can�t be serious.

HELEN
THe only one that could afford something like this would be the�

Beat

His surprised expression turns into a cunning smile.

HELEN
You�re with the embassy.

He chuckles

HELEN
I don�t know who you are or what you want but I want you to-

ISAAK
I�m no the one only one telling lies, am I �Helen�?

HELEN
I don�t know what you�re talking about.

ISAAK
Agent 746870, senait Girma of the 271th corps.
Graduated at the Sawa Defence training center. Highly decorated from the great struggle. Youngest female to be promoted to the secret service. Lead target killings behind enemy lines and domestically. Disloyal generals, dissidents, conspirators. PLotters and other enemies of the great struggle. All succumbed at the hand of our own death, Senait Girma.

SENAIT (Helen)
What. Do. You. Want?

ISAAK
I�ve come to give you an offer.

SENAIT
For what you offer I have no want.

ISAAK
This is from the highest place, first off:
Full pardon for deserting the Eritrean defence force and illegally exiting the country.
They are willing to exempt you from the 2% annual tax of your income in this country, that you owe in back taxes. Your army pension restored.

SENAIT
And what do you want in exchange?

ISAAK
The opposition is getting to comfortable in this country, starting to make too much noise. We need to send them a message. No matter where you are, if you tell lies about Eritrea of the president, you pay.

SENAIT
I�m not interested in politics, I just want to live my life here in peace. I�ve forgotten everything that I�ve learned in the army.

She rises and opens the door to the hallway.

SENAIT
I appreciate the offer, you can tell the general that, but I�m afraid I�m not interested. Now please leave.

Isaak smirks. She points at the door resolute.

ISAAK
Let me ask you something. Tell me this, do you feel safe in this country?

She meekly lowers the arm that was pointing at the door.

Isaak noticies a framed photo standing on the window seal next to him, he reaches for it. Looks at it fondly.

ISAAK
Well this has to be your daughter that I�ve heard so much about. Really adorable.

INSERT: Isaak is holding the photo of SENAIT hugging REBECCA.

TEENAGE BEDROOM.
JESSICA and WENDY are putting their jackets on.

WENDY
Come on, it will be fun.

REBECCA
I�m tired. And I got homework.

JESSICA
You can do that later

REBECCA
Sorry, guys. I�ll pass on this one.

WENDY
(smiling)
So boring.

Jessica and Wendy head for the door.

KITCHEN

ISAAK places the framed photo on the table.


ISAAK
Really adorable, just to bad there is no man in the house, right?

WENDY (O.S)
(from the hallway)
Text me when you�re done, �aight?

A series of slow motion shots.

SENAIT turns her head looks out in the hallway.

JESSICA & WENDY POV: passing by the kitchen door, they see Senait

SENAIT POV: the girls passes the kitchen door.

Isaak noticies the girl pass the door.

Senait looks down as they pass.

Isaak gives them a smile.

The girls look away.

We hear the front door open.

STAIRWELL (end of slowmo)
JESSICA slams the door to the apartment as she and WENDY walk away on their phones.

WENDY
I love her mom but sometimes she�s a bit too psycho

JESSICA
Yeah, I know.

The two talk down the stairs and disappear.

KITCHEN

SENAIT snatches the framed photo off the table, and puts it in a cabinet above the sink. She scrapes off some leftovers from the dishes.

SENAIT
I don�t remember anything from that time. I left that side of me when I fled Eritrea. I can�t help you. Now please go.

Isaak sits, undeterred.
TEENAGE BEDROOM
REBECCA is doing her homework, she stops writing. Raises her gaze and thinks.

KITCHEN

ISAAK
You don�t remember anything? Really? I find that hard to believe. No from what I heard you were a fine specimen. I spoke with the general and heard a thing of two.

Senait puts down the dishes, standing still, head bowed.

ISAAK
Told me that he was a sergeant when you were a cadett.

He lights a cigarette, takes a drag.

ISAAK
Told me about how they took turns with you. First you reistend then there was only crying, eventually that stopped too.

He blows some smoke and chuckles.

ISAAK
When a woman stops crying, you know that she is truly, irreversibly, broken.

He takes another drag on the cigarette.

ISAAK
Would be unfortunate if you had to witness your daughter go through something like that? Wouldn't it?

He chuckles.

INSERT: SENAIT opens a kitchen drawer and pulls out a ruger sr 22 with a lr silencer.

PUI! PUI!

INSERT: ISAAK is hit two times between his crossed eyes.
Blood stains on the wall behind him.

Isaak�s torso leans forward as it tips over. His punctured forehead hitting the kitchen table. A puddle of blood pours around his head.

INSERT:
CU of REBECCA entering the kitchen, lifting her gaze of her phone. Noticing SENAIT by the sink, looking downwards. Rebecca turns and looks at the kitchen table, at her mother, at the table.

Senait stares at the dead body, unflinched by Rebecca entering the room.

Rebecca goes up to her mom and hugs her.

Senait is undeterred, still pointing at the corpse.

Rebecca holds her tight.

INSERT: XCU on SENAIT as a tear runs down her cheek.

INSERT: We reveal what SENAIT is actually holding in her hand; a hand mixer.

INSERT: The kitchen table, no sign of Isaak.

In slowmotion: The hand mixer slips out of her hand, sails downward and hits the kitchen floor.

Senait brings her reached out arm inwards and pulls her daughter to her chest.

REBECCA
It�s ok mom. It�s OK.

THE END.
